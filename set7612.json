By using the built-in rotation sensor, the intelligent motor can be made to align with other motors on the robot so that it can drive in a straight line at the same speed. It can also be used to give an accurate reading for experiments. The motor case design also makes it easy to assemble gear trains.\nTacho feedback to one degree of accuracy\n160-170 RPM\nRunning torque of 20 N.cm (approximately 30 oz\/in)\nStall torque of 40 N.cm (approximately 60 oz\/in)\nAuto-ID is built into the EV3 software","review_difficulty":null,"set":"EV3 Large Servo Motor","star_rating":5.0,"theme":"MINDSTORMS\u00ae","val_star_rating":5.0,"country":"GB"}
