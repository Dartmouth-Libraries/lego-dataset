It can also send single sound waves to work as sonar or listen for a sound wave that triggers the start of a program. Students could design a traffic-monitoring system and measure distances between vehicles, for instance. There is an opportunity to discover how the technology is used in everyday items like automatic doors, cars and manufacturing systems.\nMeasures distances between one and 250 cm (one to 100 in.)\nAccurate to +\/- 1 cm (+\/- .394 in.)\nFront illumination is constant while emitting and blinks while listening\nReturns true if other ultrasonic sound is recognized\nAuto-ID is built into the EV3 software","review_difficulty":"Challenging","set_name":"EV3 Ultrasonic Sensor","overall_rating":3.5,"theme_name":"MINDSTORMS\u00ae","value_rating":4.0}
